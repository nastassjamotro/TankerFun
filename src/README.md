# Welcome to the actual code of this most wonderful program/code whatchamacallit!
## You shall find nothing helpful in this section!
## Go read the initial README at the "home" page of this repository. There you shall find out more about this most wondrous program. It's not that hard. Only one mouse click away. Go do that if you're confused...even though upon opening and running the application, everything looks self-explanatory.
