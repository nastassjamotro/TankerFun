### This is a simple GUI Application with nothing fancy going on upon running the program.

- Upon initially running the program, you'll have the opportunity to manually enter a guestimate of how many ounces of anything you drink per day and then your estimated lifespan. Can be either how old you are now. Or some age in the future that you just want to see for curiosity.

- After putting those two numbers in and hitting the "calculate" button, at the bottom of the screen it will give you the approximate amount of _**how many 11,000 gallon tankers**_ you'll drink in the estimated lifespan that you've provided

### Here's how it should look like upon running!
